# Resolving Stale Commit Issue on Main Branch

## Current Status
After analysis, the main branch is already in sync with origin/main and there are no stale commits present. However, here's the complete process for resolving stale commit issues.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Check Current Branch Status
```bash
git status
git branch -vv  # Shows all branches and their tracking status
```

### 2. Switch to Main Branch
```bash
git checkout main
# If main branch doesn't exist locally:
git fetch origin main:main
git checkout main
```

### 3. Reset Local Changes (if any)
```bash
# Discard any uncommitted changes
git reset --hard HEAD

# Alternative: stash changes if you want to keep them
git stash push -m "Temporary stash before sync"
```

### 4. Pull Latest from Origin
```bash
# Ensure we have latest remote refs
git fetch origin

# Pull latest changes from main
git pull origin main

# Or force reset to match origin exactly:
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### 5. Verify Sync Status
```bash
git status  # Should show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
git log --oneline -5  # Check recent commits
```

## Current Repository State

- **Main branch**: ✅ In sync with origin/main (commit: 74d4b94)
- **Working tree**: ✅ Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **Remote tracking**: ✅ Properly configured
- **Build status**: ✅ Project builds and lints successfully

## Commands Used to Verify

1. `git fetch origin main:main` - Created local main branch from origin
2. `git checkout main` - Switched to main branch  
3. `git pull origin main` - Confirmed already up to date
4. `npm install && npm run build && npm run lint` - Verified project health

## Resolution

The stale commit issue has been resolved. The main branch is now:
- ✅ In sync with origin/main
- ✅ Has no uncommitted changes
- ✅ Ready for new work

You can now safely work with the main branch or create new feature branches from it.
